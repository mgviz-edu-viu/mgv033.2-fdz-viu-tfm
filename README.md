# FPLC (Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography) Protein Purification
## **Goal:** get enough amount of protein, with at least a minimum % purity, that allows a post-purification experiment

## Steps:

  - Protein design

  - Protein induction

  - Chromatography purification

    3.1. Capture
    
	    3.1.1. If protein contains SUMO, cleave after capture

    3.2. Intermediate

    3.3. Refinement
